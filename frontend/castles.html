        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Castles is a turn based card game meant to be played with themed poker cards, but plain old Bicycle cards
            will work just as well. The game can be played with just the rules on this page, or each player can use the
            special rules from any one of the decks on the <a href="/castles/#decks">Decks</a> page</p>

        <h1>Setting Up</h1>
        <div class="list">
            <p>• Each player shuffles their deck: a standard 52-card deck with 2 jokers added.</p>
            <p>• The Wall: Each player sets 5 cards on the table face-down in landscape orientation.</p>
            <p>• The Garrison: Each player sets 3 cards on the table face-down in portrait orientation.</p>
            <p>• The Hand: Each player draws 3 cards from the deck as their starting hand. Players may keep their hand
                hidden from other players.</p>
            <p>• Randomly determine a player to take the first turn, then players take turns proceeding clockwise.</p>
        </div>

        <h1>Taking a Turn</h1>
        <div class="list">
            <p>• Draw until you have 5 cards in your hand.</p>
            <p>• The player to your left at the start of your turn is your opponent for this turn.</p>
            <p>• Play one card as your army, and one card as your general for this turn.</p>
            <p>• With your army card, you must attack your opponent's wall cards until your army card is defeated or
                your opponent has no cards remaining on their wall.</p>
            <p>• To attack: Select any of your opponent's wall cards. If that card is face-down, flip it face-up.
                Compare the number on the two cards, the card with the lower number is usually defeated and
                placed into the discard pile, with some exceptions:</p>
            <div class="list">
                <p>◦ Aces have a value of 1. Jacks are 11, Queens are 12, and Kings are 13.</p>
                <p>◦ If the lower number is exactly half the value of the higher number, the lower number wins. (Note
                    that this means Sixes beat Queens)</p>
                <p>◦ Aces defeat any face cards.</p>
                <p>◦ Aces defeat any card that shares a suit with them.</p>
                <p>◦ A joker cannot attack; when a joker would attack it uses its ability instead. To use the joker, you
                    have three options:</p>
                <div class="list">
                    <p>1. Cannon: Remove a card on any player's wall.</p>
                    <p>2. Reveal: Reveal all cards on any player's wall.</p>
                    <p>3. Reinforce: Add two cards to any player's wall.</p>
                </div>
                <p>◦ Any card that attacks a Joker is defeated, and the joker also uses its ability.</p>
                <p>◦ When attacking as a general, the Joker defeats any card.</p>
            </div>
            <p>• If the two cards have the same number, both are defeated.</p>
            <p>• If your army is defeated, the wall card remains face-up on the wall.</p>
            <p>• If your army is NOT defeated, you must attack again until the army is defeated or your opponent's wall
                is empty.</p>
            <p>• If your opponent's wall is empty, you then attack their garrison cards with your general until your
                general is defeated or your opponent has no cards remaining in their garrison.</p>
            <div class="list">
                <p>◦ If you fail to defeat all of the cards in your opponent's garrison, your opponent immediately
                    rebuilds their wall with 5 new cards from the top of their deck.</p>
                <p>◦ If you defeat all of the cards in your opponent's garrison, that player loses and your turn is
                    over.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h1>Winning</h1>
        <div class="list">
            <p>• When a player has no cards remaining in their garrison, that player loses and takes no more turns.</p>
            <p>• The last player with any cards in their garrison wins.</p>
        </div>

        <h1>Other Rules</h1>
        <div class="list">
            <p>• When a player has no cards remaining in their deck, that player shuffles their discard pile back into
                their deck.</p>
            <p>• When a joker is revealed anywhere other than being played as a general, it uses its ability immediately
                and is then discarded.</p>
            <p>• If any player's last wall card is removed by means other than an attacking army (such as a Joker's
                Cannon ability), the player to their right plays a general from their hand to attack the garrison.</p>
            <div class="list">
                <p>◦ This does not change the turn order.</p>
            </div>
            <p>• If a player must play a card from their hand but their hand is empty, they play the top card of their
                deck instead.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
