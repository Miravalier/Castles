        <h1>Setting Up</h1>
        <div class="list">
            <p>• Give each player a standard 52-card deck with 2 jokers added. Each player shuffles their deck.</p>
            <p>• The Wall: Each player sets 5 cards on the table face-down in landscape orientation.</p>
            <p>• The Garrison: Each player sets 3 cards on the table face-down in portrait orientation.</p>
            <p>• The Hand: Each player draws 3 cards from the deck as their starting hand. Players may keep their hand
                hidden from other players.</p>
            <p>• Randomly determine a player to take the first turn, then players take turns proceeding clockwise.</p>
        </div>

        <h1>Taking a Turn</h1>
        <div class="list">
            <p>• Draw until you have 5 cards in your hand.</p>
            <p>• The player to your left at the start of your turn is your opponent for this turn.</p>
            <p>• Select one card as your army, and one card as your general for this turn.</p>
            <p>• With your army card, you must attack your opponent's wall cards until your army card is defeated or
                your opponent has no cards remaining on their wall.</p>
            <p>• To attack, compare the number on the two cards. The card with the lower number is usually defeated and
                placed into the discard pile, with some exceptions:</p>
            <div class="list">
                <p>◦ Aces have a value of 1. Jacks are 11, Queens are 12, and Kings are 13.</p>
                <p>◦ If the lower number is exactly half the value of the higher number, the lower number wins. (Note
                    that this means Sixes beat Queens)</p>
                <p>◦ Aces win against any face cards.</p>
                <p>◦ Aces win against any card that shares a suit with them.</p>
                <p>◦ A joker cannot attack, when a joker would attack it uses its ability instead. To use the joker, you
                    have three options:</p>
                <div class="list">
                    <p>1. Cannon: Remove a card on any player's wall.</p>
                    <p>2. Reveal: Reveal all cards on any player's wall.</p>
                    <p>3. Reinforce: Add two cards to your own wall.</p>
                </div>
                <p>◦ Any card that attacks a Joker is defeated, and the joker also uses its ability.</p>
            </div>
            <p>• If your opponent's wall is empty, you then attack their garrison cards with your general until your
                general is defeated or your opponent has no cards remaining in their garrison.</p>
            <div class="list">
                <p>◦ If you fail to defeat all of the cards in your opponent's garrison, your opponent immediately
                    rebuilds their wall with 5 new cards from the top of their deck.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h1>Winning</h1>
        <div class="list">
            <p>• When a player has no cards remaining in their garrison, that player loses and takes no more turns.</p>
            <p>• The last player with any cards in their garrison wins.</p>
        </div>

        <h1>Other Rules</h1>
        <div class="list">
            <p>• When a player has no cards remaining in their deck, that player shuffles their discard pile back into
                their deck.</p>
